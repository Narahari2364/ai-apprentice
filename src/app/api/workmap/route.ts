const INSTRUCTIONS = `You turn a recorded expert work session into a Work Map that a new hire can learn from.
You get screen events (what happened on screen, with mm:ss times) and the voice transcript between the expert and an apprentice agent (questions, answers, debrief, teach-back).

Return JSON only, exactly this shape:
{
  "task": string,                       // one line, what the expert was doing
  "steps": [{
    "id": "s1", "order": 1,
    "title": string,                    // short imperative, e.g. "Set Type of Meal from the receipt"
    "time": "mm:ss",                    // the screen event time this step links to
    "decision": string,                 // "" for routine steps; for judgment calls what was decided, e.g. "Changed Type of Meal to Eat In"
    "reason": string,                   // the reason, paraphrased
    "expertQuote": string,              // the expert's OWN words from the transcript, verbatim
    "guardrails": string[]              // limits, exceptions, when to stop and ask; short imperative sentences
  }],
  "gaps": string[],                     // questions still unanswered after the debrief
  "confirmed": boolean                  // true only if the expert confirmed the apprentice's teach-back
}
Events come from the app itself [dom] and from a vision model reading the screen [vision]; the same action may appear twice, so merge duplicates.
Rules: 5–9 steps in chronological order. Every judgment call and guardrail must come from the transcript or events, never invented. Prefer generalised steps ("Attach the PL approval when over €30 per person") over one-off ones.`;
